PRESENTATION

- introduce ourselves
  - graduated with a bachelor of science,



- user story
  - Davey uses an excel spreadsheet to schedule mentors and lecturers
  - Talk about interviewing him and some mentors about what they would like to see in a scheduling app



- tech stack, ReactJS, Rails,
  why we chose react - most of functionality is on a single page - things to automatically update, have all your manditroy informatin on one platform
  - rails -> wanted to challenge ourselves by learning somethign we werent as familiar with. with our experience with ruby on rails we preferred those methods of querying and setting out database.



- Stretch goals
  - automatically generate shifts needed based on cohort/ student number
  - employees can request to swap shift with another employee, or drop shift
  (they can only request time off right now)
  - link to salary thing
  - app version- use react native
  - published schedule



- Challenges - redirecting with React, late in project wanted to bring in React router but that was going to be super timeconsuming
