PRESENTATION

- introduce ourselves
  - graduated with a bachelor of science,


Ally
- user story
  - Davey uses an excel spreadsheet to schedule mentors and lecturers
  - Making app transferable (thinking about how others would use it)
  - Talk about interviewing him and some mentors about what they would like to see in a scheduling app



Daniel
- tech stack, ReactJS, Rails,
  why we chose react - most of functionality is on a single page - things to automatically update, have all your manditroy informatin on one platform
  - rails -> wanted to challenge ourselves by learning somethign we werent as familiar with. with our experience with ruby on rails we preferred those methods of querying and setting out database.


DEMO APP

<!-- Michael
- Stretch goals
  - automatically generate shifts needed based on cohort/ student number
  - employees can request to swap shift with another employee, or drop shift
  (they can only request time off right now)
  - link to salary thing
  - app version- use react native
  - published schedule -->



- Challenges - redirecting with React, late in project wanted to bring in React router but that was going to be super timeconsuming



DEMOING ACTUAL APP

start: daniel on landing page, go into admin page, explain calendar view
        then daily view, with brief introduction of all features

Michael: demo functionality of sidebar - add employee, change
        availability, add shift, see changes on daily view page

        see each individual employee

Ally: switch tabs to employee page, brief explanation of what they see
        request time off
        go back to admin page - see notifcation (accept or deny request)
        maybe say stretch goal of having an app that deploys the schedule
        if you try to add shift on that day, it wont let you because you have accepted their timeoff request






Things to fix - automatic changes after you submit something
  - notifications work
  - showing an employee with actual upcoming shifts
  - fill forms faster
  - when submitting availabilities, automatically go back to employee view
  - when adding a new employee, make sure it renders automatically if you delete them

Ally things for you to do
  - get employee calendar view farther to the left
  - see back button at all times (sidebar is fucking it up)
  - try to get symbol on tab to not be react symbol
