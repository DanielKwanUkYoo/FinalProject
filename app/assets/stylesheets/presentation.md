PRESENTATION

- introduce ourselves

- user story
  - Davey uses an excel spreadsheet to schedule mentors and lecturers
  - Talk about interviewing him and some mentors about what they would like to see in a scheduling app

- tech stack, ReactJS, Rails,

- Stretch goals - app version, React Native, we have no security right now
  - automatically generate shifts needed based on cohort/ student number
  - employees can request to swap shift with another employee, or drop shift
  (they can only request time off right now)

- Challenges - redirecting with React, late in project wanted to bring in React router but that was going to be super timeconsuming
